#  Student Placement Intelligence System

##  Overview
The Student Placement Intelligence System is a machine learning–based project designed to predict student placement outcomes using academic performance, technical skills, internships, and extracurricular attributes.  
The system also provides probability-based risk scoring to help institutions identify students who may require early intervention and skill development support.

##  Objectives
- Perform data preprocessing and handle missing values  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Apply feature engineering techniques  
- Train and evaluate classification models  
- Predict student placement probability  
- Identify key employability factors  

##  Dataset
The dataset contains student-related attributes including:
- Academic scores  
- Specialization  
- Work experience  
- Salary details  
- Placement status  

Dataset file: `placementdata.csv`

##  Methodology
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Training using ML algorithms  
5. Model Evaluation using classification metrics  
6. Prediction and Insight Generation  

##  Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  

##  Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1 Score  

##  Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

##  Results
The developed machine learning model effectively predicts student placement outcomes and highlights important employability factors such as academic performance, specialization, and work experience.

##  Future Scope
- Deploy as a web application  
- Use advanced machine learning models  
- Integrate real-time dashboards  
- Expand dataset for improved accuracy  
- Include behavioral and skill-based assessment data
